# Transformer Evaluation Repository

This repository contains data, results, and visualizations generated during the evaluation of the **Jimple-to-JVM Bytecode Transformer**. It provides comprehensive resources, including source JARs, transformed classes, generated JARs, performance metrics, and plots for a detailed analysis of the transformation process.

## Folder Descriptions

### 1. `SourceJARs`
This folder contains the original JAR files used as input for the evaluation of the transformer. These JARs represent the baseline for comparing the results of the transformation process.

### 2. `ProducedJARs`
This folder contains the JAR files generated by the **Jimple-to-JVM Bytecode Transformer**. These JARs are the output of the transformation process and serve as the primary artifact for evaluation and validation.

### 3. `Stats`
The `Stats` directory contains JSON files that capture detailed evaluation data. The results are organized into the following subfolders:

- **`Semantics`**: This folder contains JSON files that store the results of the semantic correctness evaluation. These tests validate that the generated bytecode maintains the same behavior as the original JARs.
  
- **`Textual_and_Performance`**: This folder holds results related to textual equivalency and performance comparisons. It includes metrics for:
  - Textual comparison between the original and transformed bytecode.
  - Performance measurements for the transformation process (Bytecode-to-Jimple and Jimple-to-Bytecode).

### 4. `plots`
The `plots` folder contains graphical representations of evaluation data. These plots provide a visual summary of the performance and accuracy metrics, making it easier to interpret the results of the transformation process.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Evaluation Data**: Use the JSON files in the `Stats` directory to gain deeper insights into the transformer's performance, correctness, and accuracy.
2. **Visualization**: The plots in the `plots` folder can help you quickly grasp key metrics related to transformation performance and semantic correctness.
3. **Reproduce Experiments**: Utilize the JAR files from the `SourceJARs` folder as inputs and compare them with the corresponding JARs in `ProducedJARs`.
